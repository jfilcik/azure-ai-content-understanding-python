    "# Move Training Data Across Analyzers\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to reuse training data from an existing analyzer when creating a new analyzer in the same Azure AI Content Understanding resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have an analyzer with training data and want to create a new analyzer using the same labeled examples, you can reference the existing blob storage location without duplicating or moving the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "- **No data duplication**: Reuse existing training data without copying\n",
    "- **Same resource**: Both analyzers access the same blob storage\n",
    "- **Field portability**: Maintain stable `fieldId`s across analyzers\n",
    "- **Rapid iteration**: Test schema variations quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "1. An existing analyzer with training data already configured\n",
    "2. Azure AI service configured by following the [configuration steps](../README.md#configure-azure-ai-service-resource)\n",
    "3. Required packages installed"

    "🎉 **Congratulations!** You have successfully:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Retrieved an existing analyzer with training data  \n",
    "✅ Extracted the training data configuration  \n",
    "✅ Created a new analyzer referencing the same training data  \n",
    "✅ Verified both analyzers work correctly  \n",
    "✅ Tested both analyzers with a sample file  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No data duplication**: Both analyzers reference the same blob storage location\n",
    "- **Same resource**: Both analyzers use the same authentication and access permissions\n",
    "- **Field portability**: You can maintain stable `fieldId`s across different analyzer versions\n",
    "- **Rapid iteration**: Test schema changes quickly without re-uploading training data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stable field IDs**: Keep `fieldId`s consistent across analyzers for easier migration\n",
    "2. **Version control**: Maintain analyzer schemas in source control\n",
    "3. **Documentation**: Document which blob paths contain which training datasets\n",
    "4. **Testing**: Always test a new analyzer before deleting the original\n",
    "5. **Naming conventions**: Use descriptive analyzer IDs that indicate purpose and version\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modify the field schema in the new analyzer to test different configurations\n",
    "- Add additional training data to improve both analyzers\n",
    "- Use this pattern to create A/B testing scenarios\n",
